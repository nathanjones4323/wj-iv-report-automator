**This app is a tool to automatically generate and fill out reports for students being evaluated for an [IEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualized_Education_Program)**

The reports use data gathered and generated under the [Woodcock‚ÄìJohnson Tests of Academic Achievement (WJ IV)](https://riversideinsights.com/woodcock_johnson_iv) framework to assess a student's cognitive abilities.

This application can be used by educators under the following assumptions:
1. Your school uses [Riverside Score](https://riversidescore.com/) to generate Woodcock‚ÄìJohnson Tests of Academic Achievement and Oral Language
2. You have 1+ saved *Examinees* in the "My Recent Examinees" table üëá
